Just a quick note:

The blog will be inactive until the beginning of September.

No new posts nor the [5 Things to Read This Week](http://thatsabug.com/tag/5-things-to-read.html) for awhile.

![Sad Dog]({{ "assets/sad_dog.jpg" | absolute_url }})

In the next few weeks I will be focused on other things, but I will
use this time to create some posts (tutorials specially), re-vamp the blog layout, add some pagination, and (finally) add a comment section.

![Happy Cat]({{ "assets/happy_cat.jpg" | absolute_url }})

You can sign up the [RSS feed](http://thatsabug.com/feed.xml) to get the new posts as soon as they are out.

See you then... ;)
