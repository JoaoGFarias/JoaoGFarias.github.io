# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})


- **[Front-End Micro Services](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/blog/front-end-micro-services/index.html)**
  - I guess this is the first text about micro services ideas in the frontend I've seen - although I have worked on a couple of sites that were composed by multiple independent small applications, using Java Applets and full of iframes (Welcome to Hell). Although I am sceptical on keeping a good User Experience when multiple teams work in a quasi-descentralized fashion on the frontend, micro services has proven over and over again to enable groups to work better. Let's see if this idea on the frontend will spread out...  
- **[Project Team Roles and Responsibilities at Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/12/06/software-team-roles/)**
  - Although I don't know anyone who works there, Atomic Object seem to be a great company. The "roles" are well-defined in their responsabilities, but the table and the message at the end of the post really put a smile on my face :D
- **[Risk-based Testing](https://qablog.practitest.com/risk-based-testing/)**
  - Good 35-min podcast about risks in software projects and how to discover and attack them.
- **[Assert Your Style - Testing CSS in Ember Apps](https://simplabs.com/blog/2018/12/10/assert-your-style.html)**
  - I've tried to do some CSS checking on some Ember projects, but they were not as well-structured and well-thought as this approach from Simplabs. Worth reading regardless of working on Ember or other framework.
- **[How to Reproduce a Bug](http://thethinkingtester.blogspot.com/2018/12/how-to-reproduce-bug.html)**
  - [Kristin Jackvony](https://twitter.com/kristinjackvony) always comes with great texts - talking about the foundations of testing and the basis of the craft. I have to confess I've fail into trying to reproduce bugs on a brute-force manner a couple of times in the last few years - I will re-read this post the next few times, in order to incorporated these ideas.
