# JMeter Variables

## Where are we?

On the last post we created the foundation for investigating the performance of the orderbook service of [Mercado Bitcoin](https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br), a Brazilian cryptocurrencies exchange.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/JoaoGFarias/JoaoGFarias.github.io/blob/master/assets/jmeter/post1/jmeter_basics.jmx).

For this post we will start from a more developed suite.

![New suite]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/updated_suite.png" | absolute_url }})

In a summary, we have:

* Two Thread Groups: One for the cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC) and one for Bitcoin (BTC);

* For each Thread Group we will hit two endpoint: 
  * _Orderbook_: the list of _asks_ and the list of _bids_
  * _Trades_: A list of all completed trades, with information such as price, amount, and date.
