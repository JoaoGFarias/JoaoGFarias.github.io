# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- **[Node.js & JavaScript Testing Best Practices](https://medium.com/@me_37286/yoni-goldberg-javascript-nodejs-testing-best-practices-2b98924c9347)**
  - This text will take ~30 min, but it worth it. [Yoni Goldberg](https://medium.com/@me_37286) gives 29 tips, divided in 4 sections, about tests (checks) in Javascript. 
  
    - "The Test Anatomy" goes into the basics explain anti-patterns in unit tests; 
    - "Test Types" tells us about different types of tests that complements unit tests, with focus on the Test Pyramid (Consumer-Driven Contracts is particulary interesting);  
    - "Measuring Test Effectiveness" talks about code coverage (take a look at the Mutation Testing section);
    - "CI & Other Quality Measures" goes into how to incorporate tests into the building process.
    
- **[A process has no name](https://www.trisweb.com/blog/a-process-has-no-name/)**
  - [Tristan Harward](https://www.trisweb.com/blog/author/trisweb/) discusses about the benefit of **not** naming same things that we do. Weird? It seemed to me as well, but Tristan convinced me otherwise...

- **[Breaking the Test Case Addiction](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2019/01/breaking-the-test-case-addiction-part-1/)**
  - Part 1 of 3 of a blog series by [Michael Bolton](https://twitter.com/michaelbolton?lang=en), discussing how to move from test cases to other forms of traceability, both increasing flexibility and clarity, but without loosing confidence in coverage.

- **[The Bed of Procrustes by Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRN_KT17mNo)**
  - An animated video summary of the book of aphorism of [Nicholas Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntale). My two favorite?

    - "A good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation."
    - "You can tell how uninteresting a person is by asking him whom he finds interesting."  

- **[charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming)**
  - Another one of those awesome GitHub lists! This one comes with a series of tasks, concepts and tips on how to move towards becoming great programmer, from algorithms knowledge to tips on text editor configuration and soft skills.
