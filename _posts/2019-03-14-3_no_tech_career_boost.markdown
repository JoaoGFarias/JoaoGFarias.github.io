# Career development and Via Negativa

If you haven't started during school or early college, you probably realized the necessity of constant professional improvement to develop your career. Even with some years of work in our backs, courses and new experience help us to have an ever bigger impact in our teams and companies.

This is **completely** true!  


But since there are already plenty of people discussing how to add these new skills to your belt, I will talk in this post about **non**-technical actions you can take that will boost your career - although they are not directly related to your daily work.

_How doing something not related to my work can help me to work better?_, you may ask.

Fair question. And it is there where the concept of Via Negativa comes in:

A Via Negativa approach tries not to solve a problem or act smartly, but instead looks for avoid the bad consequencies and not act studly.

A Via Negativa action will try to create the possibility for good things to happen by removing the bad things.

In our context, I will show three Via Negativa actions that will remove some recurring problems of modern life that may make your professional development more difficult.

So... let's do it:

## Create an Emergency Fund
## Exercise
## Clean your Enviorment
