# Career development and Via Negativa

If you are not still in school or in early college, you probably realized the necessity of constant professional improvement to develop your career. Even with some years of work on our backs, courses and new experiences help us to have an ever bigger impact in our teams and companies.

This is **completely** true!  

But since there are already plenty of people discussing how to add these new skills to your belt, I will talk in this post about **non**-technical actions you can take that will boost your career.

_How doing something not related to my work can help me to work better?_, you may ask.

Fair question. And it is there where the concept of _Via Negativa_ comes in:

A _Via Negativa_ approach tries not to solve a problem or to act smartly, but instead tries the bad consequences and not act stupidly.

A _Via Negativa_ action will try to create the possibility for good things to happen by removing the bad things.

In our context, I will show three Via Negativa actions that will remove some recurring problems of modern life that may make your professional development more difficult.

So... let's do it:

## Create an Emergency Fund

### Definition

An Emergency Fund is an investment stash that covers 6 to 12 months of your expenses.
_"your expenses"_ seems precise, but it is not. In the case of an emergency fund, we are talking
about the minimum to keep you alive and fairly confortable.

It will probably include renting, food, basic transportation and internet (COME ON!), but some 
other things may be added according to your life. I, personally, include two in-house pizza nights
and 50% of my regular educational/books budget. A $80 dollar wine every week and semestral trips will
probably **not** be included here.

Monthly savings of 20% of this minimum are already a good starting point - although killing possible
debts can be workable along this savings, if it is something your struggling as well.

### Why would I need this?

The Emergency Fund will remove a good portion of the "what if (something bad) happen?" from your life
and give you the freedom to pursue something better with full force.

If you are stuck in a toxic work environment or if you see that your work do not create loops that enhance
your professional development, your Emergency Fund will be your safety net to say ... to all this and look
for something better. Also, if your employer politely dismiss your efforts, you can be less desperate.

This freedom will not improve your life as a professional per se, but it will enable you to make some
moves towards it that would be too risky otherwise. Knowing that life in our hands is truly empowering.

### Tips

Remember I said an Emergency Fund is an **investment**?

It means you shouldn't pile some money under your bed or put it in a savings account (don't put any
money on those).

But don't worry if you don't understand investments. An Emergency Fund requires only two charateristic
in the investment:

- Inflation matching growth: Once you create the Emergency Fund, you shouldn't have to worry about putting
more money there - you should "forget" about it and only use for emergencies. Therefore, you should look
for an investment that matches your personal inflation (the prices of the things you considered in the
creation of the Fund) **for sure** - no variable growth or risk of loosing money.

- D+1 maximum reclaim time: It means that the investment should be transformable in money in your account
in 24h or less. Since we want to be prepared for emergencies, we want to be able to put our hands on this
money quickly and without bureaucracies. It usually implies less growth on the investment, but the first tip
makes it clear we are not looking for extraordinary growth at this point.

## Exercise

Side-by-side with good nutrition and inner-psychologic understanding, the single-most force to keep the human
machine functioning is exercising.

The small and constant stress and deterioration that weight-lifting and running cause on bones and muscles
are essential to keep them healthy. And more than that, they benefit from the small dosages of chaos - becoming
stronger and stronger every week.

Exercises can help you in your career by keeping you on the game for more time. During your 20s and 30s, your body can deal
with pretty much any lifestyle. However, from 40 years old onwards, the body will no longer be able to follow the intensity
of the mind - you will be less willing to travel and to stand long hours of work. On the other hand, during 20s and 30s, you
will be still growing in your career, your ability ot impact will be limited. Later stages of your careers is when you have the
experience and influence to cause big impact - and it is in that period that you will need a strong body.

The exercising period can serve as moments for meditation and relaxation from everyday life, when the control of the environment
and goals is yours and yours only.

### Tips

- Make the exercising period short and frequent: I prefer 1-1,5 hours session 3-4 times per week. It allows me to go strong at each
session while not taking a big portion of my agenda;

- Engage in activities in which you can constantly progress: The idea to increase the likelihood of engaging in the activity itself
in a constant manner. If we are talking about something that one cannot get "better", such as dishwashing, the level of motivation to
perform the activity is low. In exercising, I would say that nothing is easier to track progress that weightlifting and running. Activities
like soccer or martial arts, although funny and with great benefits, are harder to measure progress.

- Face it like a profession: It may sound extreme, but the exercise of thinking about exercising (going meta...) will fool your mind
that constant progress and frequency are important. If you think about yourself as a professional weightlifter, every time you miss
the gym, you use bad form or have a regression in load you will automatically reflect how can you compensate for it, instead of thinking
"Ah... not a big deal".
