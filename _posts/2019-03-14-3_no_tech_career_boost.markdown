# Career development and Via Negativa

If you are not still in school or in early college, you probably realized the necessity of constant professional improvement to develop your career. Even with some years of work on our backs, courses and new experiences help us to have an ever bigger impact in our teams and companies.

This is **completely** true!  

But since there are already plenty of people discussing how to add these new skills to your belt, I will talk in this post about **non**-technical actions you can take that will boost your career.

_How doing something not related to my work can help me to work better?_, you may ask.

Fair question. And it is there where the concept of _Via Negativa_ comes in:

A _Via Negativa_ approach tries not to solve a problem or to act smartly, but instead tries the bad consequences and not act stupidly.

A _Via Negativa_ action will try to create the possibility for good things to happen by removing the bad things.

In our context, I will show three Via Negativa actions that will remove some recurring problems of modern life that may make your professional development more difficult.

So... let's do it:

## Create an Emergency Fund

## Definition

An Emergency Fund is an investment stash that covers 6 to 12 months of your expenses.
_"your expenses"_ seems precise, but it is not. In the case of an emergency fund, we are talking
about the minimum to keep you alive and fairly confortable.

It will probably include renting, food, basic transportation and internet (COME ON!), but some 
other things may be added according to your life. I, personally, include two in-house pizza nights
and 50% of my regular educational/books budget. A $80 dollar wine every week and semestral trips will
probably **not** be included here.

Monthly savings of 20% of this minimum are already a good starting point - although killing possible
debts can be workable along this savings, if it is something your struggling as well.

## Why would I need this?

The Emergency Fund will remove a good portion of the "what if (something bad) happen?" from your life
and give you the freedom to pursue something better with full force.

If you are stuck in a toxic work environment or if you see that your work do not create loops that enhance
your professional development, your Emergency Fund will be your safety net to say ... to all this and look
for something better. Also, if your employer politely dismiss your efforts, you can be less desperate.

This freedom will not improve your life as a professional per se, but it will enable you to make some
moves towards it that would be too risky otherwise. Knowing that life in our hands is truly empowering.

## Tips

Remember I said an Emergency Fund is an **investment**?

It means you shouldn't pile some money under your bed or put it in a savings account (don't put any
money on those).

But don't worry if you don't understand investments. An Emergency Fund requires only two charateristic
in the investment:

- Inflation matching growth: Once you create the Emergency Fund, you shouldn't have to worry about putting
more money there - you should "forget" about it and only use for emergencies. Therefore, you should look
for an investment that matches your personal inflation (the prices of the things you considered in the
creation of the Fund) **for sure** - no variable growth or risk of loosing money.

- D+1 maximum reclaim time: It means that the investment should be transformable in money in your account
in 24h or less. Since we want to be prepared for emergencies, we want to be able to put our hands on this
money quickly and without bureaucracies. It usually imply less growth on the investment, but the first tip
makes it clear we are not looking for extraordinary growth at this point.
