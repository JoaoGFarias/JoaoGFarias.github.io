## In the last episode...

... we've [learned](http://thatsabug.com/2019/02/01/postman_runner.html) how to investigate the Trello
API using Postman Runner to [run a series of requests in sequence](http://thatsabug.com/2019/02/01/postman_runner.html#execution) and the [setNextRequest function to repeat the same request multiple times](http://thatsabug.com/2019/02/01/postman_runner.html#postman-flows-with-setnextrequest).

You can get the suite here and run it by yourself:

**This is great!**

But if we observe closely, we will see that the tests for each request ask questions about a single entity:

- The **board** creation request checks if the **board** was created with the proper name;
- The **card** moving request checks if the **card** was inserted on the target list;
- The **board** deletion request checks if the **board** no longer exists;
- ...

However, the update of a certain entity may cause a chain of consequences in other entities.
In this post, we will focus on investigating how creating a card entity can affect a list entity.
In particular, we will check if the number of cards associated with a list is incremented 
after creating a card in it.

Recent versions Postman provide a powerful tool for it: The _**sendRequest**_ function.

## Postman's _sendRequest_

Postman's _sendRequest_ function allows us to make generic HTTP calls and act
of its response the same way we deal with the responses from our "main" request.

The function has the following signature:

```javascript
pm.sendRequest(URL,  (err, res) => { ... });
```

The first argument (_URL_) is the target endpoint we want to investigate, passed as a string. It
can also be of a Javascript Object type, specifying many details, such as _method_ or _headers_.
This is outside the scope of this post, but Postman's blog has an example: See it [here](https://blog.getpostman.com/2017/10/03/send-asynchronous-requests-with-postmans-pm-api/).

The second argument is a _callback_ function. If haven't deal with asynchronous programming in
Javascript before, a _callback_ is a function that is executed after receiving a response.
The first argument of this function will store any error (such as a timeout) that the response may have
and the second argument will have the response itself.

Inside this function where we will perform our work on the list entity, **from inside the card creation request**.
We will do this in two steps:

1. Store the number of cards before the card creation request is sent, on the _Pre-request Script_ tab;

2.  On the _Tests_ tab, we will fetch the number of cards again and check if it is an increment over the number of cards before.

### Finding previous number of Cards

The [Trello API](https://developers.trello.com/reference/#listsidcards) has an endpoint
that allows us to fetch the cards of a given list, as a _JSON List_.
The cURL call to this endpoint has the following format:

```console
curl --request GET --url https://api.trello.com/1/lists/{id}/cards
```

Additionally, we need to pass our credentials. The URL would be something as follows:

```console
curl --request GET --url https://api.trello.com/1/lists/{id}/cards/?token={token}&key={key};
```

To form this URL, let's firstly start creating the credentials strings by taking the values from
our environmental variables:

```javascript
const token = "token=" + pm.environment.get("trelloToken");
const key = "key=" + pm.environment.get("trelloKey");
```

Next, let's create the whole parameters request string by appending these credentials to the _TODOListId_ we have stored while creating the list:

```javascript
const requestParams = "/1/lists/" + pm.environment.get("TODOListId") + "/cards/" + "/?" + token + "&" + key;
```

Lastly, we can append this parameters request URL to Trello API's base URL:

```javascript
const url = pm.environment.get("trelloAPIURL") + requestParams
```

With the whole URL, we can call this endpoint and store in a environmental variable
the number of cards before the new card creation:

```javascript
pm.sendRequest(url, (err, res) => {
    if (!err) {
        pm.environment.set("numberOfCards", res.json().length);
    }
});
```

We already the understand _pm.environment.set_ function from [previous posts](http://thatsabug.com/2019/01/10/intro_postman_trello.html#step-1-create-a-board).
_res.json().length_ says to interpret the response as a JSON object and to return the _length_ of this object - because Trello's API returns a list of _cards_
on the called endpoint.

OBS: For simplicity, we are not handling the case of error. How would you deal with it?
Maybe mark some flag to avoid making the test itself, give that the setup step failed...

In summary, this is the code we will have on _Pre-request Script_ tab:

![Pre-Request Script]({{ "assets/images/postman_sendRequest/trello_sendRequest_prescript.png" | absolute_url }})

With this, we will have the number of cards **before** the creation of a new card in the _numberOfCards_ variable.

### Testing if number of cards is updated

Now, we will validate the increment in the number of cards **after** the creation of one card.
Since we want to act right after the request is completed, we will write some code in the _Test_ tab.

Although it is an ugly code smell, we can copy the code we wrote to create the URL:

```javascript

const token = "token=" + pm.environment.get("trelloToken");
const key = "key=" + pm.environment.get("trelloKey");
const requestParams = "/1/lists/" + pm.environment.get("TODOListId") + "/cards/" + "/?" + token + "&" + key;
const url = pm.environment.get("trelloAPIURL") + requestParams
```

And call this URL, now creating a test inside the callback body:

```javascript
pm.sendRequest(url, (err, res) => {
    pm.test("Card list was incremented after creation", () => {
        // Our test
    });
});
```

Again, for simplicity, we are not dealing with errors.

The test code is have three steps:

1. Fetch the previous number of cards, saved on the environment variable;
2. Fetch the current number of cards from the response;
3. Check if the current number of cards is an increment of the previous number of cards.

```javascript
const previousSize = pm.environment.get("numberOfCards");
const updatedSize = res.json().length;
        
pm.expect(updatedSize).to.eql(previousSize + 1);
```

The whole block of test code is as follows:

![Test Script]({{ "assets/images/postman_sendRequest/trello_sendRequest_test.png" | absolute_url }})

## What can be improved

### Code quality

I said that code and paste was ugly. It is actually the ugliest form of duplication, because it is due pure lazyness of the programmer.
Centralizing pieces of code in external Javascript files, as a library, would solve this problem.

However, Postman still doesn't allow this ([and there is an open ticket for this request since 2015](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/1180)). Workarounds exist, such as use Javascript _eval_ function. Details can be found [here](http://blog.getpostman.com/2015/09/29/writing-a-behaviour-driven-api-testing-environment-within-postman/); but be careful: [eval has its drawbacks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/86513/why-is-using-the-javascript-eval-function-a-bad-idea).

### Depth of testing

In this post, we checked only the number of cards returned by the API. However, since all information about the cards is returned on the async call we did, we could add many more checks:

- Check if the recently created card is on the list, by checking its ID;

- Check the content of each card in the list;

- Cards ordered by creation date, if that is something expected;

## Conclusion

We have added to our Postman techniques belt the ability to investigate the consequences of our action of other requests, by using the _sendRequest_ function.
Although some drawbacks regarding code quality exist in this approach, it can still be useful when to avoid artificial requests and tests, keeping the cohesion
of our suite.
