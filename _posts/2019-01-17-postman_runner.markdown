## In the last episode...

// TODO - Recap the Trello API suite from last post
// TODO - Problem: How to create an execution flow of all requests, so we can test the flow with only one click

You can download the suite here and run it by yourself:

## Conclusion

We've seen how to integrate the execution of many requests [we've created before](http://thatsabug.com/2019/01/10/intro_postman_trello.html) using Postman Runner. Additionally, we were able to create specific flows for request re-use, using nextRequest function.

With these tools, we can indeed simulate the end-to-end usage of the Trello's API with only one click!
