# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- **[On the Impact of Programming Languages on Code Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10220)**
  - Great paper from the Cornell University where GitHub projects in eleven different languages are analysed regarding bugs.
- **[The 5 unit testing guidelines](https://xebia.com/blog/the-5-unit-testing-guidelines/)**
  - Quick tips to keep unit tests clean and useful.
- **[Unit Testing Code Boundaries](https://8thlight.com/blog/ashley-bye/2019/06/04/unit-test-code-boundaries.html)**
  - Unit testing at the boundaries (external system and standard libraries) of an application is hard and ends up creating [_integrated tests_ (a scam)](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/integrated-tests-are-a-scam). Ashley Bye give us some tips how to deal with tests in these areas.
- **[The Complete Guide to Deep Work](https://doist.com/blog/complete-guide-to-deep-work/)**
  - Be able to concentrate in a task essential to get things done, and the world runs in ways to make it harder and harder. The tips here may help you to mitigate these difficulties.
- **[Types and Tests](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/06/08/TestsAndTypes.html)**
  - Uncle Bob discusses the relation of unit tests and type systems: Can a type system eliminate the necessity for unit tests? Is creating tests easier in static or dynamic languages?
