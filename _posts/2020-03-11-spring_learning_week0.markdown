# Learning Spring with Kotlin - Sprint 0

# Context & Goals

A few months ago I started working at [FreeNow](https://free-now.com/) with focus on Backend Testing, dealing with a challenge environment of hundreds of services (micro-services, if you like the buzzword), alongside great smart developers and testers. In this time, I've learned many techniques and approaches - many of them I've described on my [Automation Guild 2020 talk](https://guildconferences.com/conferences/automation-2020/).

On basis of this environment is the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework), for both Inversion of Control and application development. 

Spring, 17 years after its initial release, is myriad of topics, from security to testing, passing through configuration, internationalization, etc etc etc. My goals will be the following:

1 - Create REST APIs, automatically built and checked;
2 - Understand Spring Configuration, in its different approaches to separate the application from its data;
3 - Create examples of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), and [Clean Architecture](hhttps://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=sr_1_1);
4 - Hardcore [TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U) at every checking level, from hand-written stubbing unit checking, to databases with [TestContainer](https://www.testcontainers.org/), service contract with [Pact](pact.io), advanced test doubles with [Mockk](https://www.testcontainers.org/), etc.
