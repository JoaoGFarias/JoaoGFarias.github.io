# 30 Days of Automation

This text was written as an answer to the "30 Days of Automation in Testing" Challenge. Check it out in the [Ministry of Testing forum](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-automation-in-testing).

## Greg Paskal's "Test Automation in the Real World"

The second day of #30DaysOfAutomation is one of the simplest: Start reading a book related to automation, in order to comment about it by Day 30.

Although I had in my to-read stack some classic and books that I am more anxious to read (and re-read), as [Mosley's "Just Enough Software Test Automation"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/637583.Just_Enough_Software_Test_Automation) and [Graham's "Experiences of Test Automation"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12563795-experiences-of-test-automation?ac=1&from_search=true), I will play safe and pick a shorter and easier to read: The 100 pages long ["Test Automation in the Real World: Practical Lessons for Automated Testing", by Greg Paskal](https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B015LMDJ1S/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb_br-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) will be my choice.

Amazon reviews are a fight of oppositions: Only 4-5 stars comments or 1-start comments - nothing in the middle.

For its extent, I do not expect to have an detailed description of practices, cases, and ideas, but maybe one thing or two can trigger some interesting reflections.

Let's see...
