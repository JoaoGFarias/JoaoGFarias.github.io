# Adding Chaos to Learning

One of the worst habits that school systems create in most young folk is that structure and
_the best path_ will be handed to them by default. Clearly, on initial levels on education - but not
uncommonly extending until bachelors programs, and even on the professional academic field - the _steps_,
_points_, _levels_ and _requirements_ will appear.

Have you ever stumbled on [any list _from beginner to advanced_](https://whatpixel.com/best-java-books/) or request for such?

It's understandable the search for such guidelines: They help the person to follow a path and connect the dots.

However, there are three major problems with such approach:

1 - **The dots were already connected**: Any guide will be proposed by someone - meaning that it will carry any pre-concept
from this person or group about what is important and how things are related. Hardly it will match what is important
**to you** and how things are related in **your understanding**.

2 - **It doesn't allow exploration**: "The path is this" can speed up your walking towards the final destiny, however,
it does not (or hardly) allow you to see what is around the path. Every problem and concept is multifaceted; and every
course will show you just a handful of these perceptives.

3 - **You are protected from mistakes**: Have you ever taken a course where the instructions were to
look at the raw documentation and try out many things that will end up being wrong? Yeah... and these mistakes provide deeper and broader understanding of the problem.


So, how to fight out of this situation without re-inventing the wheel?

Following a Barbell Strategy, we can balance the bad aspects of structured learning paths with some chaotic and
unstructured learning. By exploring _unkown unknows_ we can broad our chances to find opportunities that can shift drastically
our learning.

# The Learning Quadrants

After reflecting on my typical learnign scheduled, I've realized that I could categorize the many ways I absord information
in 4 areas - Let's call them **The Learning Quadrants**:

![The Learning Quadrants]({{ "assets/images/learning_quadrants/basic_learning_quadrants.png" | absolute_url }})

## The Axis: Attention and Goal

The Quadrant has two axis of interpretation.

The _Attention_ axis is related to the level of concentration that I use during the learning process.
For instance, if I am reading a technical book and taking notes, I can classify this activity as _Deep_
in Attention, because I close my mind to any other sort of information. OBS: I use to listen to music
during Deep Attention activities, but they serve just as background noise. On the other hand, if I am copying
information from hand-written notes to a mindmap software, probably my mind can be significally free - therefore,
I can say this is a _Shallow_ Attention activity.

The second axis is related to the level of structure this learning activity - the _Goal_ axis.
Back to the technical book, if my goal is to read it cover to cover throughout months to master its topic, I can say
that this is a _Specific_ Goal activity. However, if I will watch 15 Youtube videos talking about investments, programming,
testing, fitness, and the latests political scandal, I can say this is a _Exploratory_ Goal activity.

## Examples in the Four Areas

What can we fit in each area?

### Area 1: Shallow and Exploratory

This is the more relaxed area. Most of the times, these activities are performed to avoid time waste
in our daily routines.

Out of the top of my head, I can think of:

- Reading (or listening) aphorisms / personal development books while commuting;

- Talking to friends about some interesting topic in a bar;

- Watching random (somehow) educational videos (cat videos do not count);

- Skimming blog posts from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

### Area 2: Shallow and Specific

Here we are adding some more structure by focusing on a single topic, but usually the time
dedicated to the activities will make the learning shallower.

Shallow and Specific could be...

- Watching a programming Youtube playlist while eating popcorn all the time, without practising;

- Reading a philosophy or technical book as it was a fiction book;

- Discussing freely with a friend about a topic.

### Area 3: Deep and Exploratory

### Area 4: Deep and Specific
