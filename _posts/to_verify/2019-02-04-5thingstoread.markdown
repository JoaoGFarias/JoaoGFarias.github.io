- **[Modern Testing Principles](https://ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/modern-testing-principles)**
  - Alan Page's Modern Testing Principles is another list of statements highlighting how testing and quality is more about knowledge, understanding the user and continuous improvements than techniques (such as the [Agile Testing book](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Guide-Testers/dp/0321534468) may seem to suggest) and standards.
- **[Test Specification and Metrics for API Testing](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/test-specification-and-metrics-for-api-testing/21937)**
  - Discussion about meta-topics on API Testing

  - "We are 90% done" is not done.
- **[What Are the Limits of the Scrum Framework?](https://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2019/01/what-are-the-limits-of-the-scrum-framework.html)**
  - 11 characteristics under which Scrum works well and 6 industries where it is not indicated.
