- **[Explaining Agile - Martin Fowler and Neal Ford at USI 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE6lbPLEAzc)**
  - Martin Fowler and Neal Ford talk a bit about recurring problem in agile teams: Most people understand "how to be agile", but do not understand "why be agile?"
- **[Dilbert - Why are we always "behind the schedule"?](https://dilbert.com/strip/2018-11-18)**
  - Sometimes we see we are behind the schedule, but do not remember the origin of the schedule itself.
- **[Why Don't Managers Understand What Good Testing Is?](http://rhythmoftesting.blogspot.com/2018/11/why-dont-managers-understand-what-good.html)**
  - The Internet gives people access to the most experience people in each field. Very often, experts are simply wrong - **CONTEXT** is essential. You say to your manager that your context is different and the expert's solutions would not work for your product. That's it, right - problem solved? Maybe not...
- **[A Day with Cypress Part 2](https://dragonsforelevenses.com/2018/11/13/a-day-with-cypress-part-2/)**
  - Cypress is one of the more awesome tools that allow you to "test the UI" instead of "test through the UI". Differently from [Ember Testing tools](http://thatsabug.com/2018/08/08/testing_ember_application_first_steps.html), it is application tech stack agonistic.
- **[If we do a sanity testing before release, then do we need to do regression testing again? - Michael Bolton on Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-we-do-a-sanity-testing-before-release-then-do-we-need-to-do-regression-testing-again)**
  - Context is essential - "proven" receipts do work... for the contexts they were implemented. So, when is regression testing necessary?
