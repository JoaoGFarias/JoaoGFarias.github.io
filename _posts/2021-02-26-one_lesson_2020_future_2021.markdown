## One lesson from 2020

Hi there! It's been a long time, right?
Last post here was on May the 4th of 2020 (No Star Wars pun intended).

As it probably was for you, last year was a crazy ride for me.

Throughout these months I experienced many changes in my work at Free Now.
One of the directions I went (and I am still going) is to work more closely
to the developers, helping them to become better testers, making them better developers as by product.

The [QA TechTalks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICtGIYYw2E3NLSp4P-017w) channel
invited me to talk for 5 minutes about this.

## A look into 2021

At the beginning of April the blog will return as usual:

- The weekly [_5 Things to Read_ series](http://thatsabug.com/tags/#5-things-to-read);
- Coding and tools tutorials (Good stuff on TDD, Design Patterns, and Kotlin coming...);
- Book reviews and commented reading;
- Discussions about the nature of testing and software quality;

Additionally, probably starting from June/July, That's A Bug will expand itself
to video format, with a **Youtube channel**, discussing the topics we have in the blog,
so the visual folks will be more satisfied. If you want to subscribe right now, you can

Two final big changes coming as well are:

- A logo (we need a face to put on swag :D);
- Moving the blog from Jekyll to Wordpress, so we can have a more powerful basis
where to build interactions and richer content.
