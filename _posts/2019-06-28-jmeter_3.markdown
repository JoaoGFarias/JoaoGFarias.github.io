# JMeter Assertions

![JMeter]({{ "https://jmeter.apache.org/images/jmeter.png" | absolute_url }})

Following our JMeter series we reach a point where we are able to create different scenarios
for testing multiple endpoints, [using Thread Groups and Listeners](http://thatsabug.com/2019/06/06/jmeter_1-jmeter_basics.html),
and avoid duplication of configuration [using variables](http://thatsabug.com/2019/06/21/jmeter_2.html).

Theses tools allow us to evaluate the responses' contents and the time took to them to reach us back.

However we would see a failure only if a request fails to return a 200 OK.

In situations of heavy load, all sort of problems can happen on the server:

- Response's content may be corrupted;
- Specific response can take a long time to return, which is not acceptable for some products;

Additionally, we may want to investigate how the server reacts in situations different from
200 OK:

- If a resource does not exist, does the system returns a 404 fast enough?
- If a server error occurs (500 code), does the system continues to work properly?

To answer such questions, it is necessary to run additional validations to each request.
In JMeter, these validations are called _Assertions_.

Let's take a look at some of the most simplest, but useful JMeter Assertions.

# Types of Assertions

JMeter offers a vast range of Assertions:

| Type                	| Usage                                                                                                                          	|
|---------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Response Assertion  	| Apply a string pattern to verify against the server response                                                                   	|
| Duration Assertion  	| Check the response was received within a given elapsed time                                                                    	|
| Size Assertion      	| Check the size of the server response contains the wanted number of bytes                                                      	|
| XML Assertion       	| Check the response is a valid XML document                                                                                     	|
| Beanshell Assertion 	| Execute your own logic using Beanshell scripting                                                                               	|
| MD5Hex Assertion    	| Allows to check the MD5 hash of the response data (great for static files)                                                     	|
| HTML Assertion      	| Check html response syntax using JTidy                                                                                         	|
| XPath Assertion     	| Tests if a document is well-formed, with possible DTD validation, or putting the document through JTidy and testing with XPath 	|
| XML Shema Assertion 	| Validate an XML response against an XML schema                                                                                 	|
| JSR223 Assertion    	| Run your own code logic using a JSR223 Script                                                                                  	|
| Compare Assertion   	| Compares results between themselves                                                                                            	|
| SMIME Assertion     	| Evaluate the sample results from the Mail Reader Sampler                                                                       	|
| JSON Assertion      	| Execute JsonPath expressions and validate Json documents                                                                       	|

For this post, we will focus on Response Assertion, Duration Assertion, and JSON Assertion.
