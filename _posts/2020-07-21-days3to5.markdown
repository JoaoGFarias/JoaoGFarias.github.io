## Day 3: Explore “The Club” and Contribute

## Day 4: What types of testing can automation support you with?

My answer considered a slightly different question: "How can automation support testing?". Check it out [here](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/30-days-of-automation-in-testing-day-4-what-types-of-testing-can-automation-support-you-with/16223/23?u=joaofarias).

## Day 5 - Find, use and share your thoughts on a web UI testing tool

Some links regarding Ember.js tools to testing. Check it out [here](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/30-days-of-autoamation-testing-day-5-find-use-and-share-your-thoughts-on-a-web-ui-testing-tool/16427/18?u=joaofarias).

One comment in the thread of this day caught my attention:
[Mark (mwinteringham)](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/u/mwinteringham) make a comment regarding how often people use automation UI tools to test other parts of a system, such as the backend. He created a mnemonic called TuTTu (Testing the UI or Testing Through the UI).
