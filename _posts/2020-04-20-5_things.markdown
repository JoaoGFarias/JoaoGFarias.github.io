- **[Aaron Shekey - Building dark mode on Stack Overflow](- **[Aaron Shekey - Building dark mode on Stack Overflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0MXE8Onkh4)**
)**
  - A couple of weeks ago Stack Overflow released its dark mode feature. Very nice job, although I personally haven't enabled it, because I use the [Dark Reader Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader-dark/kbbbldgkhcpkmmjbjelmkjkchibeklng) to create dark mode on every site. Anyway, this blog post is a walk on the development process that Stack Overflow passed. Interesting to see the different iteractions and analysis to reach the best work possible. Kudos to Stack Overflow frontend folks!


- **[Charles Proxy Rewrite Tool](https://embeddedbits.org/how-is-the-linux-kernel-tested/)**
  - Charles Proxy serves to help with network analysis and recording. I prefer it over [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for its ease of to use, slightly better IMO. If you use Charles, you may not know (as I didn't until a few days ago) about the Rewrite tool, which allows you to modify requests and responses as they pass through Charles. Very useful for mocking behavior.

- **[MoT - What is the key element you include when building a test strategy?](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/what-is-the-key-element-you-include-when-building-a-test-strategy/35406)**
  - A thread of the [Ministry of Testing Club](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/) discussing testing strategy. Worth going through everything.

- **[Ask HackerNews - Programs that saved you 100 hours?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22849208)**
  - Many people on Hacker News discussing about alternative software that helped them to be more productive.

- **[Señor Performo & Joe Colantonio - Why Performance Testing is NOT Load Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkqnh8Tj5CI)**
  - Joe Colantonio started holding weekly online meet-ups about everything automation. The first encounter is with [Leandro Melendez (Señor Performo)](https://twitter.com/SrPerf), talking about what is Load and Performance Testing. The second half is a Q&A where Leandro discusses many other aspects of Performance Testing.
