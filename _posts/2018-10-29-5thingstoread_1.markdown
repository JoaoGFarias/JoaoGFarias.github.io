- **[The Way of Tester](https://probetesting700171536.wordpress.com/2018/10/02/the-way-of-the-tester/)**
  - Robert Day have a great post series reflecting on the [A Book of Five Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Five_Rings) from a tester perspective. How 7 Samurai principles can be applied to testing? Check it out...
- **[5 Reasons you are wasting your testing time](https://qablog.practitest.com/5-reasons-you-are-wasting-your-testing-time/)**
- **[When Will Ted By Done](http://dilbert.com/strip/2018-10-20)**
  - Have you ever being asked about other's people work? Asked to estimate other's people work? Yes, me too....
- **[27 short advices for software testers](https://www.testerschoice.pro/single-post/2018/10/20/27-short-advices-for-software-testers)**
  - Following are my 5 favorites phrases:
    - "22. Report bugs even if they are not part of the tests you are currently performing."
    - "26. Join code design reviews even if most of the meeting is a waste of time. Still, you can give a valuable contribution at certain points. Heuristic: When a flow presented point to an object and ask 'what if that fails'."
    - "7. Don't be quick to answer questions about efforts even if you think people expect it from a pro like you. Sometimes small changes yield more tests than expected. Better start describing the tests needed and past experience, then estimate."
    - "3. If you are professional, don't limit yourself to tests. I surprised myself when I participated in design meetings and gave good points about general software architecture."
    - "10. When you start working for a new company, and after adjusting, suggest the good thing you learned and are relevant to your new place, like test processes. I was always excited to hear how to improve our work."
- **["Before You Log That Bug..."](http://thethinkingtester.blogspot.com/2018/10/before-you-log-that-bug.html)**
  - [Kristin Jackvony](https://twitter.com/kristinjackvony) gives us some rules of thumb to improve the bug reports, in two parts: "Check for User Errors" and "Information for the Developer".
