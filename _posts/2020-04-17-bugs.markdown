# Ouch! #1: Bugs in the Real World

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bugs_everywhere.jpeg" alt="bugs everywhere" %}

Hey, what about something new?

In this series, we will look at some news describing very nasty bugs there appeared on the news.

## Disclaimer:

The goal here **is not to bash on the companies and people involved in the products**, but to raise awareness of all of us that:

1 - We all may fail, and fail ugly;
2 - We can learn firstly from others' mistakes.

I firmly believe that openness for criticism and self-awareness of our mistakes are important practices for healthy and continuously better industry.
