Hi there!

As [said before](http://thatsabug.com/blog/back_in_september/), Tha's a Bug would be in a hiatus until September.

Well... September is here :D

The blog went through a major change in layout, adding new features powered by the awesome Jekyll theme 
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

Now we will have a dark theme, for better reading of long texts.

Right on the top you can find a link to vote for the post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (which really helps to spread the word).

On the left, you can see links to for my social networks. Also you can see a table of contents, which allows a glimpse of the post and fast navigation.

Another major feature is search throughout the whole site.
Note: Some links may be broken, because the way Minimal Mistakes create links is different. I've fixed most, I probably missed some. You can use the search to find the missing resource. If you can not find it, email me at joao@thatsabug.com.

Last but not least, we have a comment section, powered by [Disqu](https://disqus.com/).

I hope to see a lot of interaction here :D
