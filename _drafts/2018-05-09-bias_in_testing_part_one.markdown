## Oh! Our brains...

Although we like to keep see yourselves as rational beings, who when focused can use the whole
power of our brains to solve complex problems, the truth is that we are way less rational that
we would like to think.

This non-rational part of our thoughts can be divided in two categories: Emotions and unconscious thoughts.
We usually deal daily directly with the first, but the latter is frequently forgotten - we barely stop to
think about our thinking! And it can lead us to serious situations, when we make mistakes and omit procedures
even when the necessary knowledge and skill is with us.

## Not with me...

If you don't believe me, watch the video below (without looking at the title):

[![Gorilla attention test](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UfA3ivLK_tE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfA3ivLK_tE "Gorilla attention test")

Have you seen the gorilla? If not, you just had your moment of Inattentional Blindness, when your attention
was affected by other things besides physical vision capacities - in this case, your attention in the
ball passing.

In testing, we can be affected by a multitude of deviation of rational thought that will drives us away
from our full capacities of testing: We will let silly rendering bugs pass because we were focused on
the functional aspects of the new feature; we will believe some metric is very good or very bad; we
will tend to agree or disagree if people for reasons different of the arguments in question; etc. This
situations are called **cognitive biases**.

And although we **can not** eliminate completely the occurrences of **biases**, the moment we know the types
of biases that may happen, we can be more **aware** of ourselves, and detect moments when they happen.

This series posts will present list of common cognitive biases and how they can manifest in the life of a tester.
With this knowledge, you will have the right weaponry to fight against your own mind!

## Cognitive Bias list

Below is the complete list of biases that we will cover in this series, grouping the similar ones:

    * Confirmation Bias + Ingroup Bias
    * Post-Purchase Rationalization
    * Neglecting Probability + Salience + Status-Quo Bias + Hindsight Bias
    * Observational Selection Bias + Attentional Bias
    * Projection Bias + Better Than Average Bias + Mirror Imaging
    * Anchoring Effect + Contrast Bias
    * Availability Bias
    * Choice Supportive Bias
    * Moral Credential Bias
    * Self Serving Bias
    * Fundamental attribution error
    * Blind-spot bias
    * Clustering illusion
    * Informative bias
    * Place effect
    * Pro-innovation bias + Recency bias
    * Zero-risk bias

In each post, we will talk about 5 biases, explaining its generic definition, how they
manifest in software development/testing environments, and how to protect yourself and others
from them.

## Confirmation Bias + Ingroup Bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to believe that an idea is true we **would like** to it be true. It causes people to avoid researching for more information if the data so far (somehow) confirm our previous views (prejudices).

Ingroup bias is the outward version of confirmation bias. It is define as the tendency of humans to favorite members of our groups, including their ideas which has no significative base of truth. It happens because much of our self-esteem is built around our daily social interactions - the presence of certain people in our victories and development makes, sometimes unconsciously, to believe the presence itself, not the ideas and actions, is the reasons for such good moments.

## Post-Purchase Rationalization

Post-Purchase Rationalization (PPR) is happens when we overlook any faults, difficulties or defects of an expensive product we've bought in order to justify its purchase.

## Neglecting Probability + Bias + Status-Quo Bias + Hindsight Bias

## Observational Selection Bias + Attentional Bias

## Projection Bias + Better Than Average Bias + Mirror Imaging
