# The Scribe's Oath

Bob Martin (aka Uncle Bob) is one of giants of software development. Every single time I have the chance to read, and re-read, what he says, I grap my notebook and a pencil, because it is almost certian that I will get something to improve my life professional. And The Scribe's Oath (previously know as The Programmer's Oath) is one of my personal favourites lessons regarding professional ethics.

The Oath is composed of 9 statements about how software developers should face their craft, an ethical guide, inspired on egyptian scribes way of working, against a world which may transform programmers into machines of producing products - depressed and personally insatisfied machines, by the way.

Lo and behold! The Scribe's Oath:

### **In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers,** 
### **I promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:** 

1. I will not produce harmful code.
      - I will not intentionally write code with bugs.
      - This means: Do your best.
2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
4. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.
5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

Although the Oath is written under a programmer's perspective, I think the 9 promisses are applicable to any professional, including testers. I will break each part and discuss how can we fullil them (and how to detect and counter-attack risks to these ethical guides).

## Translating to the Testing World

* "I promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement"
   
   Although this statement is not an Oath, it is important. "to the best of my ability and judment" makes clear that you **will** fail at keeping the Oaths. 
   
   We are human; we learn, try stuff, fail, learn again, and eventually reach a point of considarable success. If you are in field for sometime, it is probably clear that new people will make "silly" mistakes, go to the least effient way and stop at walls all the time. And probably it is clear that regardless of your experience, everyone will do these things as well.

   This statment is a personal reminder that the Oath are guidelines, points to always aim, but circumstances (professional and personal) will cause deviations in your behaviour from these points. It is fine, since you reflect and make efforts for re-adjust.

* "I will not produce harmful code."

* "The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate."

* "I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should."

* "I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others."

* "I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them."

* "I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity."

* "I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them."

* "I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty."

* "I will never stop learning and improving my craft."
