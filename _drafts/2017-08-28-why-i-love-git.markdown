Actually, it is easier to list the reasons one would not love Git (I will do it, hold on...)

For starters, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (yes, the guy from Linux)
in 2005 and that has become de fato standard for this kind of system, dethroning long-time emperors like CVS and SVN.

I will not dig into the details of how Git works, but highlight the main reasons why I just love
using and learning about Git (the ones that make me hate it from time to time). You can checkout the Resources section at the end for link about learning Git.

##### Reasons for love:
* It's fast (very.... very fast....)

* Descentralized versioning

* It grants you great powers, but it also knows you are an idiot

##### Reasons for hate:
* Crazy/non-sense commands

* Binaries? Oh boy....

* GUIs tools

* People don't go deep

### Conclusion:
